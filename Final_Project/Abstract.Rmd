##Abstract
Cricket is one of the most popular and played sports in India. There are three standard formats of cricket matches, Five-day match (Test Match), One day match (50 overs match), and Twenty overs match (T20). During the last decade, the popularity of the T20 matches has been increased exponentially mainly due to the Indian Premier League (IPL). In the league round each team plays the other team twice and after that, the top four teams competes for the title. In this project, I am going to use the IPL data from the year 2008 to 2016. The raw data has been downloaded from [Cricsheet website](http://cricsheet.org/downloads/). This project is divided into two parts. In the first part, I am going to clean and format (tidy form) the data so that it can be used for visualization and analysis. In the next part, I am going to develop a shiny application in which the data can be analyzed by plotting and changin various parameters including year, team, player.

The github repository which I am using for this project is https://github.com/ashishjain1988/STAT585.
